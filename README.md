# Enhancing Waste Management Through Deep Learning-Based Trash Classification

## Project Overview
Efficient waste management is crucial for sustainable environmental practices. As the global population grows, the amount of waste generated also increases, making it essential to improve waste sorting and recycling processes. This project explores the application of deep learning models to automate the classification of waste into categories such as Cardboard, Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, and Trash/Non-Recyclable. By leveraging advanced image recognition capabilities, we aim to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of waste sorting, contributing to higher recycling rates and environmental sustainability.

## Features
- **Automated Waste Sorting**: Utilizes deep learning models to classify waste items.
- **Model Comparisons**: Implements and compares the performance of different deep learning architectures like DenseNet121, VGG16, and MobileNetV3.
- **Environmental Impact**: Aims to reduce landfill use and improve recycling efforts by optimizing waste sorting processes.

## Deep Learning Models Used
- **DenseNet121**: Known for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks.
- **VGG16**: A widely used model for image recognition, providing a strong baseline.
- **MobileNetV3**: Optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **TrashNet** dataset, which contains images of waste items categorized into six distinct classes: Cardboard, Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, and Trash/Non-Recyclable.
